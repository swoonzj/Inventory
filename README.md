# Inventory
## An Inventory System Designed for a Specific Retail Store

This project was started as a platform to learn C# and Windows Forms, as well as be a useful application for a Retro Gaming store.
### Features include:
  * A POS (point of sales) system, including two separate "Carts" for sales and purchases (trade-ins, people selling items, etc)
  * A Management screen for editing details of single or multiple items (Item name, Console, price, UPC, quantity, trade-in values...)
  * Incorporates usage of a UPC scanner and provides functionality for printing labels.
  * A "Large Inventory Mode" used for adding large quantities of items to the system via UPC scanner.
  * Keeps a record of transactions
  * Uses a SQL database to store data.
  * Ability to import/export database from/to a .CSV file.
  * A greeting from Professor Oak upon program opening ("Welcome back!").
  
### Features to be added:
  * A customer database
  * A customer "wishlist" of items, which will notify the user if a desired item is in stock
  * Capability to handle multiple UPCs per item (currently, each item may only have one unique UPC)
  * Various user-controlled settings (specifically, SQL database name & location, which is currently hardcoded)
  * Multi-threading


### Note:
As this is an ongoing learning project far from the finished product and certainly the biggest project I've undertaken, there are unused/incomplete/unreachable forms (i.e. 30-day-hold) based on features once (but no longer) desired, is likely riddled with less-than-ideal coding practices, and could certainly use a good cleaning.
